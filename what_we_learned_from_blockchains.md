# What we learned from Blockchains

* Better understanding of how it conceptually works
* The reference implementation (if that is what it is) is not ready for prime-time
* The code is expected to be running against the live blockchain - it's very hard to set up your own independent chain
* The proof-of-work algorithm is quite simple
* It's not easy to reason about all of the different tuneable parameters - difficulty, interval etc
* A bootstrappable implementation would be very useful - very simple setup, minimal tuning, make me a blockchain
